# AIS-Hospital
The project is developed as part of the curriculum and is not the final software.

Automation of the Hospital's activities, i.e. reducing the time spent on customer service and booking coupons.

The program allows you to perform the following tasks:
- authorization with differentiation of access rights (administrator or user);
- viewing of the Database (doctors, patients, tickets);
- adding new information to the database (doctors, patients, coupons);
- deleting and editing information in the Database (Doctors, Patients, Appointments);
- creating a new user with different access rights (administrator or user).

Additionally, there is:
- flexible error checking;
- password generation;
- selection of information from drop-down lists (for faster data filling).
